## Front-End

- [ ] Swap out useState with useRef to cause less renders to happen on the website.
      https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useref
- [ ] Discover Page, Where you can find and follow people.
- [ ] Add an about author in specific blog page on the left side.

## Back-End

- [ ] Cascade after deleting requests, this is not sql :(
- [ ] Consider Adding Upvotes/Downvotes for Blogs, think of a way to add them/ do some research.

## Ideas

- Add a grouping mechanism like threads so you can group blogs that are related together .
